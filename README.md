# New Features!
- None yet, be patient, I might add some :D.

### Tech

LittleWeeb uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

**Interface:**
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)- A slick looking CSS Framework.
* [jQuery] - duh
* [NIBL API](http://api.nibl.co.uk:8080/swagger-ui.html) - Thanks to nibl.co.uk API and the developer from NIBL to provide me the information that I need!

**Application:**
* [SimpleIRCLib](https://github.com/EldinZenderink/SimpleIRCLib) - Simple IRC Client Library for .NET C# with support for DCC Downloads.
* [SimpleWebSockets]() - Not yet released library for basic simple websockets. 
* [Chrome]() -  Used to launch the interface in App window.

### Installation & Usage
Before using this application, be sure chrome is installed. This application uses chrome to launch the interface. Best compatibility is assured with Chrome as well.

1. Go to the releases page of this repo, and download the zip file of the lastest version.
2. Extract it to wherever you want. * 
3. Run the application by running the LittleWeeb.exe executable.
4. Download your anime :D.

*(Do note, the initial download directory is set to the same location where the executable is located,which can be changed in the settings menu, if you put it in your Program Files folder, it might not work correctly if you leave the downlaod directory as is!)

### Development

This application is still in development, but I guess worthy to be thrown into the world by now. There are still a few features missing which I will add in the future (see Todos). 


### Todos

 - List already downloaded Anime.
 - Add support for latest ongoing anime.
 - Fix bugs with downloading.
 - Clean up some code.
 - Add support for running the interface and application seperate (so you can run the application on a NAS 24/7 for example).
 - Not being lazy and continue this project.
 - Make console less scary.
 - Make console dissapear.
